# Chunky
A responsive framework and methodology for writing reusable, readable, and reliable markup.

## How does it work?
A constructor method called Chunk is the gateway to writing modular and reusable HTML markup. Just write <code> var newChunk = new chunk("chunk name"); </code> to create a new chunk. With newChunk you can write all the reusable markup inside a build function. All code inside the build function executes with <code> render() </code>. This code can copied, templated, and referenced for unlimited durability.

## How is chunky different?
Chunky handles variables, validation, copies, templates, and documentation for you. This means the code you write is reusable, readable, and reliable.
